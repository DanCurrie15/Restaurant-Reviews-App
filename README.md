# Restaurant Review App
---

Restaurant Review App was built as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program

## Overview

This app lists a number of restaurants (all info on them is stored in a json) and when the user selects one on the main page, they are taken to a details page that shows additional information, such as the restaurant's hours and reviews

### Installation

1. Clone or download this project to your computer.

2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
